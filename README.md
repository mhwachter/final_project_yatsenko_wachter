## Description

This project replicates the paper Rose, A. K. (2004). Do We Really Know That the WTO
Increases Trade? *American Economic Review*, *94*(1), 98â€“114.
https://www.doi.org/10.1257/000282804322970724.

No replication code and only the final dataset was available on the website of the
journal. First, we tried to replicate the results with the available final dataset.
Second, we tried to source as much data as possible from the original sources and tried
to replicate it that way. The following data is used:

- International Monetary Fund: Direction of Trade Statistics
- Central Intelligence Agency: World Factbook
- World Bank: World Development Indicators
- Bureau of Labor Statistics: Consumer Price Index

The projects creates a final document called `replication_ppr.pdf` with all regression
tables we were able to replicate. Because the analysis of the original paper was
conducted with Stata and ours was primarily done with R, the results can vary a bit
(especially since it involves unbalanced panel data). The paper contains two sections:
"1 Original Data" with the results we obtained from using the original dataset, and "2
Sourced Data" with the results obtained from our own data.

## Requirements

To run this project working versions of the following system requirements need to be
present:

project in. Then, clone the repository

```console
git clone https://github.com/mhwachter/final_project_yatsenko_wachter
```

navigate to the root directory of the project and create and activate the environment
with

```console
